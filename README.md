# CS162_L3_Inheritance
A game of war developed in C++. Moving into more OOP concepts we're now building inheritance into programs. War is a 2-player game played through dice. The player who rolls a higher number gets one point. If both players roll the same number, it is considered a draw and no one gets a point. However, the two dice classes used inherit different properties and one set of dice is loaded.
